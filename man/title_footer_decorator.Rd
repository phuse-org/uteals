A function to create a UI component for selecting a title and footer
for tables or plots. It reads title information from a specified Excel
file and allows users to choose a title from the provided options.
It also provides user with flexibility to customize the title and footer
according to their specific needs.
}
\details{
The module creates a UI with a dropdown for selecting a title.
Once a title is selected, it updates the output by either adding titles to
a table or modifying a plot's title and caption accordingly.
Additionally, it includes a checkbox that user can check to enable
customization, allowing them to enter their own values for the title and
footer in the designated input fields.
