**Designer**: Sohan Lal  
**Concept**: This design prioritises instant recognition over artistic flair. I used a universal UI language, showing a funnel filter, a shield protecting, and brackets framing. By stripping away gradients and complex shading, we ensure the sticker remains legible even at small icon sizes. It is a utilitarian badge for a utilitarian tool, simple and direct.
