**Filename**: `uteals_hex_alanharrison.png`  
**Designer**: Alan Harrison  
**Concept**: I wanted to keep a strong link to the original teal package so I used a similar gridded backdrop and colours. Taking inspiration from the design brief, I created a background of building blocks in a bar chart, then I brought in the tools element using a vector image of a spanner to form the 'U' letter of the 'Uteals' package. Overall I wanted a clean design with a recognisable link to the original teal package whilst incorporating the utilities theme.
