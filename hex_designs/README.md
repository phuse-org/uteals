**Designer**:Nadia Abraham
**Concept**: 
Blending into the Teal theme, the logo features a peacock mascot along with the clinical TLG outputs. The peacock is chosen as the bird mascot as it symbolises elegance and exquisiteness which aligns with the “uteals” package objective of adding transformators and decorators to ornately refine the data as well as aesthetically enhance the TLG outputs for superior experience.
